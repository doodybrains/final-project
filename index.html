  <h1>My Final Project</h1>
  <p>This project was made with Atom, and GitHub Desktop and Github.com</p>
  <p>I am planning to publish this site to the world wide web with something called GitHub pages, so that I can access my site after the semester is over</p>
  <p>In order to publish to github pages I need to make one more file change.</p>
